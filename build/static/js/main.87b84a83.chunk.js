The purpose of BackyardRestoration.net is to provide these individuals with some of the tools necessary to make a positive environmental impact, specifically: a weed identification and management method selection tool, a weed management timeline and a native species selection tool (all native species in my database are currently local to the Upper Midwest, which is my area of expertise).
