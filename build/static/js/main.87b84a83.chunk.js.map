Currently, I am seeking\r\n        opportunities in web development and software engineering, but am also\r\n        open to positions related to ecological/landscape design, ecological\r\n        restoration, greenhouse management, extension education and plant\r\n        health. Beyond this, I am strongly interested in promoting environmental\r\n        sustainability as well as scientific and academic writing. Prior to\r\n        obtaining a certificate in web-development from DevMountain in May of\r\n        2021 and a Master of Professional Studies in Horticulture in May of\r\n        2020, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Saint Olaf\r\n        College in May of 2015.\r\n        <br />\r\n        My DevMountain coursework covered full-stack web development\r\n        technologies in a React-based environment. More specifically, these\r\n        primarily included: Javascript, React, Redux, NodeJs, Express,\r\n        PostgreSQL, Massive, CSS, HTML5, Git, Github, Heroku, Jest, bcrypt and\r\n        axios. The curriculum also involved completion of two large projects,\r\n        including a full-stack personal project website, as well as a full-stack\r\n        group project website. The latter was completed by a group of three\r\n        students, including myself, within a remote environment leveraging git,\r\n        GitHub and Trello for project management.\r\n        <br />\r\n        When coupling my masters coursework with my previous work experience and\r\n        participation in a greenhouse production and plant-health-oriented\r\n        horticultural internship at Bachman's Inc. in 2019, I also offer a\r\n        foundational understanding of many aspects of horticulture within\r\n        commercial settings, including: plant pathology, greenhouse management,\r\n        organic fruit production and viticulture, organic vegetable production,\r\n        plant propagation, integrated and biological pest management, and\r\n        quality control. I have also completed an Ecological Restoration\r\n        Certificate from University of Minnesota Extension, and have gained\r\n        valuable ecological restoration field experience during my time as an\r\n        assistant project manager at Prairie Restorations Inc. Beyond this, I\r\n        possess strong attention to detail and have a natural talent for rapport\r\n        building and facilitating cross-functional collaboration in support of\r\n        project deliverables, allowing me to excel in self-driven and team-based\r\n        work environments. I am open to new opportunities and am highly\r\n        adaptable and teachable, possessing the ability to quickly learn new:\r\n        technologies, processes, and company standards.\r\n        <br />\r\n        Ideally, I would like to work in a role which affords me the opportunity\r\n        to combine my biology and horticultural background with my programming\r\n        skills and technical abilities.

The purpose of BackyardRestoration.net is to provide these individuals with some of the tools necessary to make a positive environmental impact, specifically: a weed identification and management method selection tool, a weed management timeline and a native species selection tool (all native species in my database are currently local to the Upper Midwest, which is my area of expertise).

Received weather data is subsequently used to calculate the user’s USDA hardiness zone and calibrate all weed management actions to the user’s growing season within the D3.js weed management timeline.

There is a public-facing portion of the site which allows unregistered users to search for games using a number of search criteria, view game details and read associated game reviews.
