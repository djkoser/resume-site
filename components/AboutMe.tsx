      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article>
        I am a former software engineer at Olive (recently resigned), a graduate
        of DevMountain&#39;s full-stack web-development coding boot camp, and
        hold a Master of Professional Studies in Horticulture from the
        University of Minnesota. Prior to this, I received a Bachelor of Arts in
        Biology from Saint Olaf College. I am open to opportunities in: software
        engineering, web development, ecological/landscape design, ecological
        restoration, greenhouse management, extension education and plant
        health. Beyond this, I am strongly interested in promoting environmental
        sustainability and fighting climate change, and would welcome any
        opportunities to do so professionally. I possess strong attention to
        detail and have a natural talent for rapport building and facilitating
        cross-functional collaboration in support of project deliverables,
        allowing me to excel in self-driven and team-based work environments. I
        am open to new opportunities and am highly adaptable and teachable,
        possessing the ability to quickly learn new: technologies, processes,
        and company standards.
        <br />

        My DevMountain coursework covered full-stack web development within the
        PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The curriculum
        also involved completion of two large projects, including a full-stack
        personal project website, as well as a full-stack group project website.
        The latter was completed by a group of three students, including myself,
        within a remote environment leveraging: Git, GitHub and Trello for
        project management.
        <br />
        <br />
        When coupling my masters coursework with my previous work experience and
        participation in a greenhouse production and plant-health-oriented
        horticultural internship at Bachman&#39;s Inc. in 2019, I also offer a
        foundational understanding of many aspects of horticulture within
        commercial settings, including: plant pathology, greenhouse management,
        organic fruit production and viticulture, organic vegetable production,
        plant propagation, integrated and biological pest control, and quality
        control. I have also completed an Ecological Restoration Certificate
        from University of Minnesota Extension, and have gained valuable
        ecological restoration field experience during my time as an assistant
        project manager at Prairie Restorations Inc.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ideally, I would like to work in a role which affords me the opportunity
        to combine my biology and horticultural background with my programming
        skills and technical abilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for taking an interest in my portfolio and I look forward to
        hearing from you.
