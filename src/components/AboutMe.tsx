      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <article>
        I am an emerging web developer at DevMountain Student Developers, and recent graduate of the University of
        Minnesota with a Master of Professional Studies in Horticulture. Currently, I am seeking opportunities in web
        development and software engineering, but am also open to positions related to ecological/landscape design,
        ecological restoration, greenhouse management, extension education and plant health. Beyond this, I am strongly
        interested in promoting environmental sustainability as well as scientific and academic writing. Prior to
        obtaining a certificate in web-development from DevMountain in May of 2021 and a Master of Professional Studies
        in Horticulture in May of 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Saint Olaf College in May of
        2015.
        <br />
        <br />
        My DevMountain coursework covered full-stack web development technologies in a React-based environment. More
        specifically, these primarily included: Javascript, React, Redux, NodeJs, Express, PostgreSQL, Massive, CSS,
        HTML5, Git, Github, Heroku, Jest, bcrypt and axios. The curriculum also involved completion of two large
        projects, including a full-stack personal project website, as well as a full-stack group project website. The
        latter was completed by a group of three students, including myself, within a remote environment leveraging git,
        GitHub and Trello for project management.
        <br />
        <br />
        When coupling my masters coursework with my previous work experience and participation in a greenhouse
        production and plant-health-oriented horticultural internship at Bachman&apos;s Inc. in 2019, I also offer a
        foundational understanding of many aspects of horticulture within commercial settings, including: plant
        pathology, greenhouse management, organic fruit production and viticulture, organic vegetable production, plant
        propagation, integrated and biological pest management, and quality control. I have also completed an Ecological
        Restoration Certificate from University of Minnesota Extension, and have gained valuable ecological restoration
        field experience during my time as an assistant project manager at Prairie Restorations Inc. Beyond this, I
        possess strong attention to detail and have a natural talent for rapport building and facilitating
        cross-functional collaboration in support of project deliverables, allowing me to excel in self-driven and
        team-based work environments. I am open to new opportunities and am highly adaptable and teachable, possessing
        the ability to quickly learn new: technologies, processes, and company standards.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ideally, I would like to work in a role which affords me the opportunity to combine my biology and horticultural
        background with my programming skills and technical abilities. Thank you for taking an interst in my portfolio
        and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
