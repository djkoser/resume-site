      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article className="textBlocks">
        I am a software engineer at Olive, a graduate of DevMountain&apos;s full-stack web-development coding boot camp,
        and hold a Master of Professional Studies in Horticulture from the University of Minnesota. Prior to this, I
        received a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Saint Olaf College. If my employment status were to change, I would
        be seeking opportunities related to software engineering and web development, but am also open to positions
        related to ecological/landscape design, ecological restoration, greenhouse management, extension education and
        plant health. Beyond this, I am strongly interested in promoting environmental sustainability, entry-level IT
        work, as well as scientific and academic writing.
        <br />
        <br />
        My DevMountain coursework covered full-stack web development technologies in a React.js environment. More
        specifically, these primarily included: Javascript, React, Redux, NodeJs, Express, PostgreSQL, Massive, CSS,
        HTML5, Git, Github, Heroku, Jest, bcrypt and axios. The curriculum also involved completion of two large
        projects, including a full-stack personal project website, as well as a full-stack group project website. The
        latter was completed by a group of three students, including myself, within a remote environment leveraging Git,
        GitHub and Trello for project management.
        <br />
        <br />
        When coupling my masters coursework with my previous work experience and participation in a greenhouse
        production and plant-health-oriented horticultural internship at Bachman&apos;s Inc. in 2019, I also offer a
        foundational understanding of many aspects of horticulture within commercial settings, including: plant
        pathology, greenhouse management, organic fruit production and viticulture, organic vegetable production, plant
        propagation, integrated and biological pest management, and quality control. I have also completed an Ecological
        Restoration Certificate from University of Minnesota Extension, and have gained valuable ecological restoration
        field experience during my time as an assistant project manager at Prairie Restorations Inc. Beyond this, I
        possess strong attention to detail and have a natural talent for rapport building and facilitating
        cross-functional collaboration in support of project deliverables, allowing me to excel in self-driven and
        team-based work environments. I am open to new opportunities and am highly adaptable and teachable, possessing
        the ability to quickly learn new: technologies, processes, and company standards.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ideally, I would like to work in a role which affords me the opportunity to combine my biology and horticultural
        background with my programming skills and technical abilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for taking an interst in my portfolio and I look forward to hearing from you.
